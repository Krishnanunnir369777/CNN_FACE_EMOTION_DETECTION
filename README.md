# Facial Expression Recognition with CNN  
## Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to classify facial expressions from images to enhance feedback mechanisms during campus activities. By understanding and categorizing emotions, this solution could contribute to real-time feedback collection and improve engagement strategies.  

## Solution
I build a model using Convolutional Neural Network , it can claasify facial expressions from images and also using OpenCV i connected model with that so it will show the emotion on the detected face.
We can implement this on the cameras at the exit of our institute event venue, by this the model can detect the emotion of the participants.Also we can upload images of the event by this also our model can detect the emotion.

## Dataset
The project uses the **FER 2013 Dataset** (Facial Expression Recognition), which contains grayscale 48x48 pixel facial images categorized into seven emotions:

- Anger  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Happiness  
- Sadness  
- Surprise  
- Neutral

  Additional preprocessing and augmentation were applied to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
