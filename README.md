# Facial Expression Recognition with CNN  
## Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to classify facial expressions from images to enhance feedback mechanisms during campus activities. By understanding and categorizing emotions, this solution could contribute to real-time feedback collection and improve engagement strategies.  

## Solution
I build a model using Convolutional Neural Network , it can claasify facial expressions from images and also using OpenCV i connected model with that so it will show the emotion on the detected face.
